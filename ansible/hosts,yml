    # Directly-named hosts. Since Ansible is built to scale, there shouldn't be
    # too many listed here, because using groups allows you to apply the same
    # config to all hosts in a group equally. Included here are a few simple
    # ones for reference. In most cases, either DNS names should resolve, or
    # there should be a corresponding host entry in your `~/.ssh/config` file.
